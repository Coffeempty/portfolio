                    <h3><span>The Pre</span></h3>
                    
                    <p>Alright, this is it. Blog uno. We start documenting the shit I do now.</p>
                    
                    <p>Primarily, this blog is for me. If you're reading it, cool. If not, also cool.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't know how often I'll write here. Daily? Weekly? Monthly? No clue. Consistency has never been my brand. But here's what I do know: putting things out there, journaling my thoughts (yes, this might turn into unfiltered shitposting, so be warned) somehow pushes me to do things worth writing about.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Documentation as motivation. Doing cool stuff so I have something to say.</strong></p>

                    <p>I've realised that knowing a little about a gazillion things is… interesting. And annoying. And confusing. And sometimes it's exhausting. It's not a new idea. People have talked about it, romanticised it, crashed out over it, written thinkpieces about it. All valid.</p>
                    
                    <p>But everything keeps circling back to one question:</p>
                    <p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Why do I want to do everything?</strong></p>

                    <p>For context, here's a non-exhaustive list of things I've explored chronologically (to say the least):</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Music (yea, I went to classical singing classes in 4th standard)</li>
                        <li>Guitar</li>
                        <li>Playing games on my computer (I mean, who doesn't?)</li>
                        <li>Cricket</li>
                        <li>Taekwondo (yup, did that shit for 2 years)</li>
                        <li>Table tennis (left this in 10th because of the great great entrance exams my prestigious high AQI nation has)</li>
                        <li>Chess</li>
                        <li>Sketching</li>
                        <li>Watercolor</li>
                        <li>Web development</li>
                        <li>Unity</li>
                        <li>Blender</li>
                        <li>Debates</li>
                        <li>Graphic design</li>
                        <li>Editing</li>
                        <li>Poetry (WITHOUT AI btw, which is why it's grammatically fucked at times)</li>
                        <li>B.Tech (in production engineering btw)</li>
                        <li>Stand-up comedy</li>
                        <li>AI / ML</li>
                        <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
                        <li>Robotics</li>
                        <li>Vlogging (one vlog counts)</li>
                        <li>And now blogging (one blog counts too)</li>
                        <li>Plus a lot of things I don't even remember.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This blog won't give you answers. Or maybe it will. I honestly don't know. The point isn't clarity; it's movement. We'll figure it out along the way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Apparently there's a sophisticated term for ingeniously dumb asses (me) like this; information-overloaded, occasionally (definitely not mostly) lazy individuals who refuse to pick one lane.</p>
                    
                    <p>They call it being a polymath.</p>
                    <p><em>(And that is what this first blog is about.)</em></p>

                    <h3><span>The Body</span></h3>
                    
                    <p><em>(supposed to be the main part of the blog but can be shorter than the other parts or can be a novel)</em></p>
                    
                    <p>The fundamental question is this, and this is also the reason I'm writing this blog btw:</p>
                    <p><strong>Why am I doing so much, yet not in a way where I actually stick to something properly?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Is it people pleasing? Or am I genuinely curious? And more importantly, what the fuck do I do now?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Or maybe the real question is this:</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do I feel alive only when I'm starting something new, and restless the moment I try to stay?</strong></p>

                    <p>The answer, in my opinion, is that we as humans, Homo sapiens, are kind of built to be multitasking creatures. We naturally have the instinct to try everything. And when that instinct doesn't fade out on time, you get people like me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Exploration is obviously important. I'm not arguing against that. But it all comes down to one simple thing: priority.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yes, ladies and mentlegen, it's really that boring.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Curiosity without priority is chaos.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Priority without curiosity is death.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>I'm trying to survive somewhere in between.</strong></p>

                    <p>I don't think there's a perfect solution to this mess. So the only logical approach is to prioritise the mess. Do whatever you want, but not at the cost of better things you could be doing. So that's the plan. I prioritise my skills, work, acads, projects, missions, side quests, whatever you want to call them, and I enforce myself to stick to it.</p>
                    
                    <p>These priorities are dynamic, obviously. I'm an evolving species. Things will change. But we'll come back at the end of good old 2026 and see if I've actually achieved anything or just yapped publicly for no reason. Putting this out here is my attempt at accountability. If nothing else, future me can cringe at this.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I Still Do, Should Do, and Want to Do:</strong></p>
                    <p><em>(priority order, for my future self)</em></p>

                    <h3><span>The Post</span></h3>
                    
                    <p>All in all, peeps, this was just me writing the infamous start-of-the-year to-do list, moulded into a blog sorta thing.</p>
                    
                    <p>The moral of the story for this blog is simple:</p>
                    <p><strong>PRIORITISE AND START DOING SOMETHING PHYSICALLY. TAKE ACTION.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>I'm not saying to pause the planning, or the thoughts, or the thinking. That's an ever-evolving process. All I'm saying is do something.</p>
                    
                    <p>We all, you all, are built to be the best. To be different. To grow. Be your best version, gang. Don't just stay alive, gang.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Breathing keeps you alive.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Doing is what proves you were ever here.</strong></p>
                    <p><em>(let that sink in)</em></p>
                    
                    <p>And be accountable for what you plan to do and whether you complete it or not. Very, very cliché, but make a list and stick it on your wall, or tell all of your friends about it, or tell your mom about it, or if you're fortunate enough, tell your girlfriend or boyfriend about it, or write a blog about it like a maniac at 3:19 am in the night.</p>

                    <p>That'll be it for this one, broskis.</p>
                    
                    <p>The blogs further can be about anything I find cool. A project I do? A hackathon I go to? World models? Cool robots? The art of writing the perfect joke? What is good typography?</p>
                    
                    <p>They can be anything I want to know more about, or anything I got to know more about.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hope this helped, and if it didn't help yourselves… y'all are genius people, who am I to help you????</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Adios, amigos.</strong></p>
